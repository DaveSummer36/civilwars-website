## CivilWars - Alpha v1.2.0 - The Exploration Update

CivilWars next huge update is arriving soon! The theme of it will be Exploration, so the <ins>Explore button</ins> will get its functitonality.
The game gets enhanced and upgraded as the UI will remain the same (no UI upgrade soon)!
New goals, new features, new buildings... That's the Exploration Update

### Here is the list of all the <ins>planned features:</ins>

* World Map gets added
* Exploration gets added as a whole
* World Map's area will be from -100 to 100 coordinates
* New way of  collecting resources (buttons and new calculation system, arriving in Alpha v1.1.1)
* New buildings: Intel and Outpost (dependent of each other)
* Exploration: Intel-like game mechanism
* Intel level system and quests based on the Intel's level

For now, that's it. These are the features planned to be released by Alpha v1.2.0.

### CivilWars - Alpha v1.2.0 - The Exploration Update - coming on March 26th, 2025

Stay tuned for more details!
